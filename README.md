# CIT 281 Lab 01

## Overview
Lab 01 focused on setting up the development environment and practicing core terminal and Git skills. The goal was to ensure your system was ready for future CIT 281 labs and projects.

## Objectives
- Install and configure development tools:  
  - Visual Studio Code (VSCode)  
  - Node.js  
  - Git and GitHub
- Practice using:
  - Terminal navigation and commands
  - Keyboard shortcuts in VSCode
  - Git basics (`git init`, `add`, `commit`, `push`)
- Create initial Node.js script and run it using the terminal
- Generate `.txt` files and `.png` screenshots to document setup and usage

## Deliverables
- `lab-01.js`: Basic Node.js file (e.g., "Hello, World!" or current date)
- `setup.txt`: Notes or output demonstrating tool installation and usage
- Screenshots of development environment, terminal usage, or VSCode setup

## What I Learned
This lab helped reinforce confidence in using the terminal and VSCode as my primary development tools. It also established the workflow for submitting zipped project folders and using Git version control.
